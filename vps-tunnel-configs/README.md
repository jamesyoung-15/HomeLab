# Config files

These are config files for tunneling traffic through a VPS to my home server via Wireguard. This way I do not have to directly expose my home server to the internet. For full setup guide and explanation see [here](../Documentation/Tunnel.md). 

The nginx config files are in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/jyylab.com` (or whichever domain was set). The Wireguard config files are into `/etc/wireguard`.
